      <h1>@DangerousSelfies</h1>
      <p>There’s nothing wrong with taking selfies…at this point, almost everyone has used their smartphones to snap photos of themselves. However, some people take it too far and take selfies in really dangerous circumstances. Between 2011 and 2017, 259 people died in pursuit of one, according to a study published by Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care. Oftentimes these selfies are taken while people are traveling, scaling skyscrapers, cliffs and bridges to capture a “viral” photo. If you want to take an amazing, cool photo, go for it, but shots shown above took things too far.</p>

      <h1>@FakeHeterochromia</h1>
      <p>Sarah McDaniel is an Instagram model who has built her entire online personality and career on her claim of having heterochromia (having different colored eyes) since birth, with one eye being a warm, chocolate brown, and the other being a brilliant blue-green. In many interviews, McDaniel talked about how she was always made fun of for her eyes growing up and how she “just wanted to be normal” and was told by people to just wear contacts to make her look “normal.” However, suspicions about her heterochromia first started running high when her eye color kept changing, and then in 2016, everything blew up when her own father exposed her by posting a childhood picture of her on Instagram captioned, “My daughter Sarah McDaniel with her real brown eyes.” This became a huge controversy, and most of the agencies and brands she worked with stopped working with her. She then was discovered to have flown to India to get a very dangerous and illegal surgery by Bright Ocular — that can potentially cause severe glaucoma, iritis, cataracts, and even total blindness in many patients — and have a blue colored lens implanted over her real iris to keep up the facade. Even after all this, she continues to repeatedly deny the claim.</p>

      <h1>@ParisPhotoshop</h1>
      <p>Why fly all the way to Paris if you can just photoshop yourself in front of the Eiffel Tower? Johanna Olsson, a 28-year-old social media influencer from Sweden, has more than half a million followers on Instagram and 33,000 subscribers on YouTube. In 2018, she found herself in a super awkward situation that cost her a huge chunk of her social media following and got her viral on national television. Johanna’s Instagram account is filled with glamorous pictures of herself against stunning backdrops, but for some snaps in particular, turns out she had photoshopped herself onto several Parisian backgrounds. Even though Johanna ended up claiming that she was actually in Paris, and only photoshopped her photos because the actual photos she took didn’t turn out nice, in Sweden, the controversy went viral and TV shows invited her to talk about her ‘fake traveling.’</p>
