        <h1>Tide Pod Challenge</h1>
        <p>In late December 2017, Tide Pods emerged within Internet meme culture, and teenagers were attracted to the zest and were intrigued by the texture of the tide pods, as it contained resemblance to Jell-O. This led to the rise of the “Tide Pod Challenge,” which involved a dare to intentionally consume the pods, biting down on them and spitting out or ingesting its contents, an act that poses serious health risks. The origins and inspiration of the challenge are murky, but jokes have circulated online about the temptation of a product that is known to be dangerous but that bears a resemblance to brightly colored candy. Mostly teens participated in the challenge, and they would record themselves chewing and gagging on the pods and daring others to do the same, with most videos being posted on YouTube. In 2017, poison control centers received reports of more than 10,500 children younger than 5 who were exposed to the pods, and nearly 220 teens were reportedly exposed, with about 25% of those cases being intentional. In  addition, in the first half of January 2018 alone, poison control centers handled 39 cases of participants of the challenge. The chemicals in the pods cause severe burns to the mouth, esophagus or respiratory tract, and some very young and very old patients with cognitive issues have been rushed to emergency rooms or even died as a result of eating the pods.</p>

        <h1>Bird Box Challenge</h1>
        <p>The “Bird Box Challenge” became a trend in early 2019, following the release of the Netflix thriller, Bird Box, in December 2018. Inspired by the film and its core concept — wearing a blindfold at all times while wandering around outside and performing various tasks —, participants of the challenge would live their everyday lives blindfolded for a certain period of time, and document their experience. Some people, like YouTube creator Morgan Adams, have tried to go about their daily lives for 24 hours while blindfolded, while others have attempted the challenge for a shorter period. The challenge has led to some insane (and dangerous) viral videos, and Netflix even had to issue a warning to people to not participate in the challenge as it could lead to hospitalization. In one video of the challenge, a group was walking together around the streets of NYC blindfolded, and one man started running and ended up falling down many stairs of a subway entrance. In another incident, a teenager in Utah got into a car accident while driving blindfolded. However, besides injuries, there’s a more serious side effect. Disability researcher Arielle Silverman and her colleagues have shown that conducting “simulations” like blindfolding among the abled can actually lead them to greater negative bias towards blindness itself. After being blindfolded for a short stint, people feel it as a more debilitating condition than it really is; they underestimate the adaptive capability of blind people and end the experiment more likely to agree with statements such as: “If I were blind, I would do anything to get my sight back.”</p>

        <h1>Eraser Challenge</h1>
        <p>The “eraser challenge” has been around for years, but in 2017 in particular, the potentially-harmful kids’ “game” made a comeback and garnered a lot of new attention as it continued to pop up on social media and intrigue more children. In disturbing photos and videos shared on social media, particularly YouTube, middle-school aged children were rubbing their skin with an eraser as hard as they can while reciting the alphabet or other phrases. It often led to skin abrasions and cuts, with the apparent goal being to see how long the participants can last, then they “compare” their wounds. The challenge may cause pain, burns to the skin, scarring, local infections, and in severe though rare cases, life-threatening sepsis, gangrene and loss of limb may occur. Dr. Wendy Sue Swanson, a Seattle pediatrician has told TODAY News that “These are kids acting like kids … It seems like there's this bravado in it, there's this easy accessibility... when you're thinking about the social dynamics of children trying to belong, trying to get attention and show strength, it isn't that surprising."</p>
