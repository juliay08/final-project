        <p>In 2017, Logan Paul uploaded a video of him and his friends at the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, which has a tragic reputation in Japan and internationally as a frequent site of suicides. Going in to film the “haunted” forest, Paul and his friends came across a man’s body, which was shown in several close-ups where only the face was blurred out. Though shocked, they also made jokes, as a member of the group was heard off camera saying he “doesn’t feel good,” to which Paul then asks him while laughing, “What, you never stand next to a dead guy?”</p>

        <p>In 2015, YouTuber Sam Pepper decided to pull a prank on a Vine user named Sam Golbach, and got Golbach’s best friend Colby Brock to get in on the joke. In the prank, Golbach and Brock are seen driving down a road when their car suddenly stops, and a masked man approaches Golbach, throws a black hood over his head, ties him up, and throws him in the trunk. The video then cuts to a rooftop, where Golbach and Brock are tied up in chairs next to each other, and the masked man then points a gun at Brock’s head as Golbach pleads for his friend’s life. Then the gun fires, and Golbach cries and screams in distress, and when Brock gets up to reveal that it was a prank and that he’s okay, Golbach is visibly shaken. The end of the video shows Golbach a couple of days later smiling and joking about the prank, but this prank clearly took it too far and is cruel and traumatizing.</p>

        <p>In January 2020, Jason Ethier, also known as ImJayStation on YouTube, posted a series of now-deleted videos claiming that his girlfriend, Alexia Marano, had been killed by a drunk driver. The first video, “My Girlfriend Alexia Died… *Rest In Paradise*” had over one million hits and was followed up the next day with a video of Ethier saying his last goodbye at Marano’s “memorial space,” with both videos being monetized and featuring merchandise links. The third video showed Ethier attempting to hold a seance for Marano to contact her spirit from ‘beyond the grave,’ In the final video posted just hours after the third, Ethier admitted that the whole thing had been a stunt to get more subscribers. When discussing the controversy, Ethier claimed Marano was involved in the plan, and the final video would have seen Ethier resurrect his girlfriend, but Marano apparently went AWOL, though this was likely just a continuation of a dumb YouTube hoax.</p>

        <p>In June 2017, YouTuber Pedro Ruiz and his girlfriend Monalisa Perez were recording a video for a new channel called Damitboy, which Perez had prefaced earlier in the day that they would be filming “one of the most dangerous videos ever,” stating that it was exclusively Ruiz’s idea. Ruiz had apparently wanted to find out whether a .50 caliber bullet from a Desert Eagle could penetrate a hardcover book, however, the stunt ended in tragedy when the bullet penetrated the book and hit Ruiz in the chest, killing him. Perez then pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter and had been facing a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and as part of the plea agreement, Perez served her 180-day jail time in her home state in 10-day increments.</p>
